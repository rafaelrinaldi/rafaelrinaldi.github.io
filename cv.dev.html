          <p>Work & Co designs and develops digital products for the world’s most respected brands. Fast Company has named it twice as one of the world’s most innovative companies and once as one of the most important design companies in existence.</p>

          <p>Joined the company still in its early days with the goal of getting exposure to a range of interesting projects. It offered me the type of environment that puts not only technical skills to the test but also creative problem-solving.</p>

          <p>Over a period of four years, I’ve contributed to the development of twelve projects.</p>

          <p>Launched together with Epic Games—the creators of the most popular video game to date: Fortnite—their brand new digital store as well as their cross-platform desktop game launcher, used daily by over eighty-five million people worldwide.</p>

          <p>Launched Delaware Life’s flagship product: Gainbridge. An online provider of simple, steady, high-yield products that empower consumers to grow and protect their savings.</p>

          <p>Launched Givewith, a matchmaking engine that connects companies with nonprofits. The project was my debut to Lisp (through Clojure) and my first experience building an ETL pipeline.</p>

          <p>Launched Oscar Health’s website. Led the front-end development of the project which aimed to revamp their website and visual brand identity, introduced an easy to use blog system and created a conversational user interface for their quote generation, tailored to user’s specific needs.</p>

          <small>Clients: ALDO Group, Apple, Delaware Life, Epic Games, Even Responsible Finance, Givewith, Google, HouseLogic.com, Oscar Insurance, Red Robin, T-Mobile and Virgin America.</small>

          <p>Led the front-end development team on the endeavor of modernizing and scaling the architecture of the largest sporting goods e-tailer in the world. Due to its massive scale, this was quite a challenge; had to create a process to allow the release new features and improvements while maintaining a large existing code base, making sure no regressions were introduced in the process.</p>

          <p>By putting together the best front-end development team in Brazil and by creating a healthy and collaborative relationship with stakeholders, I’ve managed to achieve great results at Netshoes. Done that by investing in automation and collection of metrics, treating performance and development best practices as highly important pieces of the development process, building custom tools to address internal needs, pushing for design and development teams to be highly involved in upcoming and ongoing work, creating a strong team culture by organizing internal tech talks (sometimes bringing experts from outside the company to talk and hosting local meetups at the company’s space) and making time for experimentation.</p>

          <p>To be able to come up with an action plan I had to also get a full picture of the whole architecture for the existing system, all custom built on Oracle’s E-Business Suite. This part was also mostly handled by a third party, based in California, United States.</p>

          <p>The initial work was a big effort that involved on-site collaboration with vendors, to absorb and document the system’s individual pieces and how they all fit together.</p>

          <p>At the time Natura was revamping their visual brand identity so the project also had the goal of delivering this new vision to digital platforms.</p>

          <p>The main deliverable was a design system with a list of different components that could be used independently or combined together to provide highly customizable interactions. A lot of thought was put into making it look and feel sharp, fast and interactive.</p>

          <p>The end result was a hybrid solution that could run on Android, iOS as well as web browsers.</p>

          My company worked with Work & Co on the initial build of our product, and I had the pleasure of collaborating with Rafael on the project. Not only is he a very sharp, talented engineer, but he was very patient and articulate in bringing me up to speed on the technical architecture. He's also very personable and easy to get along with, which made the experience all the more enjoyable!

          Rafael is a very talented web developer. He thrives on working with designers to build the best possible user experience within project deadlines. The quality of his code is great and his ability to ingrain code quality standards while working with a team of developers was very important on my projects. He has a great 'can do' attitude and is always excited to learn new ways of building things. I hope that one day we'll work with each other again!
